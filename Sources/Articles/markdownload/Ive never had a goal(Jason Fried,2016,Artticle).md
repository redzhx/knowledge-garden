I can’t remember having a goal. An actual goal.

There are things I’ve wanted to do, but if I didn’t do them I’d be fine with that too. There are targets that would have been nice to hit, but if I didn’t hit them I wouldn’t look back and say I missed them.

I don’t aim for things that way.

I do things, I try things, I build things, I want to make progress, I want to make things better for me, my company, my family, my neighborhood, etc. But I’ve never set a goal. It’s just not how I approach things.

A goal is something that goes away when you hit it. Once you’ve reached it, it’s gone. You could always set another one, but I just don’t function in steps like that.

When you shift from 1st to 2nd, 1st is behind you. Then from 2nd to 3rd, 2nd is behind you. I approach things continuously, not in stops. I just want to keep going — whatever happens along the way is just what happens.

I consider [Basecamp](http://basecamp.com/), my current business, as one continuous line back from when I sold the first thing I ever remember making — a logo for $50 (which happened to be for [Andrei Heramischuk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreiherasimchuk)— who knew!). I was 16 or something like that at the time. I didn’t have a goal to make two logos, or to be able to charge $5000 for a logo. I just made logos. And then I made software. And then I made web sites. And now I make software again. No goals in the process that I remember.

I just worked at whatever I was working on and ended up wherever I am. I continue to approach work and life that same way today.

If I’ve used the word goal, I didn’t mean it that way. It was just the word I picked, a synonym for something else.

I really like what Jim [Coudal](http://coudal.com/) said about goals:

> “The reason that most of us are unhappy most of the time is that we set our goals not for the person we’re going to be when we reach them, but we set our goals for the person we are when we set them.

That pretty much sums it up for me.  
我不记得有目标了。一个真正的目标。有些事情我一直想做，但如果我不做，我也不会介意的。有一些目标本可以击中，但如果我没有击中它们，我不会回头说我错过了它们。我的目标不是那样的。我做事，我尝试，我建设，我想进步，我想为我、我的公司、我的家庭、我的社区等做得更好。但我从来没有设定过目标。这不是我做事的方式。目标是当你击中它时就会消失的东西。一旦你到达它，它就消失了。你可以设置另一个，但我就是不按这样的步骤工作。当你从 1 档换到 2 档时，1 档在你身后。然后从第二名到第三名，第二名在你身后。我不断地接近事物，而不是停下来。我只想继续 — 一路上发生的事情就是发生的事情。我把我目前的业务 Basecamp 看作是我卖掉我记得的第一件东西时的一条连续生产线 — 一个 50 美元的标志（碰巧是给 AndreiHeramishuk 的，谁知道呢！）。当时我 16 岁左右。我的目标不是制作两个 logo，或者一个 logo 可以收费 5000 美元。我刚做了标识。然后我做了软件。然后我创建了网站。现在我又开始制作软件了。我记得在这个过程中没有目标。我只是在做我正在做的任何事情，结果却到了我所处的任何地方。今天，我继续以同样的方式对待工作和生活。如果我用过 “目标” 这个词，我不是这个意思。这只是我选的一个词，是其他词的同义词。我真的很喜欢吉姆・库达尔（Jim Coudal）所说的关于目标的话：“我们大多数人在大多数时候都不快乐的原因是，我们设定的目标不是为我们达到目标时将要成为的人，而是为我们设定目标时的自己。这在很大程度上概括了我的想法。
