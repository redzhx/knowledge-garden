up:: [[ACCESS 笔记组织法]]

## 我的理解

其实就是[[PARA]]，SPACES以项目action为目标，进行信息管理。但多了一个[[MOC]]，把信息串起来。我直接将其改成PARA。moc先直接放到对应文件夹里面。  
与Source相比，Spaces就像社会人，高目的性，一切以项目、闭环、完成为目标。而Source就像学生，低目的性，重在持续积累，分类，持续精进。

## 原文解释

Spaces are one of the most important parts of ACCESS:  Whenever you have something big in your life, create a new space. 

I use spaces for holding:

- My efforts for LYT.
- My non-idea, work notes for LYT.
- My non-idea, work notes for my TV Editing career.
- My personal plans and reviews.
- My personal notes on finances.
- Bigger [[Efforts]], like [[My Newsletter MOC]]. 
- New areas I'm learning, like the literary industry.
- Fun micro-efforts, like mapping issues of The Cultural Tutor's newsletter.
- Special new efforts, where I want to mindfully incubate related notes, to allow them to slowly develop.
- Folder packs I share, like the LYT Kit and Obsidian Flight School.
- Other big, hard-to-define things
- And whatever else demands its own space!

Can you see how terms like "projects" and "areas" just don't cut it? When you work with ideas, you need looser terms. 

"Spaces" are more flexible than "projects" and more versatile than "areas". Spaces contain both—and more—because they contain *efforts*.

> Between "spaces" and "efforts" and "Maps of Content", you have the terms that will allow your ideas the room to breath and the flexibility to grow.
